## Example first line: "feat: add support for Python 1.5".

## Specifically, the first line should contain a type and a description
## of the change being made. The description should be suitable for use
## in release notes, where applicable.

## User-facing change types:
## - docs: docs-only changes
## - feat: new features
## - fix: bugfixes
## - perf: performance improvements

## Internal change types:
## - build: build system changes (anything run by `make build`, mostly)
## - chore: anything that is not covered by another type
## - ci: basically anything that touches our Jenkinsfiles
## - refactor: internal refactors
## - style: style changes
## - test: new tests

## See https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ for background.

## The first line should also:
## - be at most 89 characters long
## - contain a description that is at most 72 characters long
## - not end with sentence-ending punctuation
## - start (after the type) with a lowercase imperative ("add", "fix")

## The second line should be empty, per normal Git convention. The
## remaining lines should be limited to a reasonable length (72
## characters is common), though there's currently no enforcement for
## that.
