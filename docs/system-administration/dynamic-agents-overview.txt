Dynamic Agents Overview
=======================

Determined consists of several components:

-  a **master** that schedules workloads and stores metadata
-  one or more **agents** that run workloads, typically using GPUs

When running Determined with Dynamic Agents, the Determined master dynamically
provisions and terminates cloud instances to meet the needs of the
cluster.

-  Provisioning new Determined agents is quick: we make API calls to the cloud
   provider to provision new instances within a few seconds of new tasks
   arriving. Within a few minutes new instances will have registered
   themselves with the Determined master and start running tasks.
-  When Determined agents become idle, we give them a five minute grace period
   before terminating the instances. This grace period provides for a
   short interval of time for the Determined agent instance to receive new
   tasks.

The Determined master and agents should typically be installed and configured
by a system administrator. Each user of Determined should also install a copy
of the command-line tools, see :ref:`install-cli`.
