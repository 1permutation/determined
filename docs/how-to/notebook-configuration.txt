Notebook Configuration
======================

Determined makes it easy to modify the dependencies that are installed into
the notebook's environment:

.. code::

   $ det notebook start --config environment.tensorflow=1.13.1

More generally, notebooks may be supplied an optional **notebook
configuration** to configure the notebook's enviornment. In addition to
the ``--config`` flag, configuration may also be supplied via a YAML
file (``--config-file``):

.. code::

   $ cat > config.yaml << EOL
   description: test-notebook
   resources:
     slots: 2
   environment:
     python: "3.6.9"
     tensorflow: "1.13.1"
     keras: "2.2.4"
   bind_mounts:
     - host_path: /data/notebook_scratch
       container_path: /scratch
   EOL
   $ det notebook start --config-file config.yaml

See the :ref:`Notebook Configuration <command-configuration>` section for full
documentation of the supported configuration options.

.. _cpu-only-notebooks:

Example: CPU-Only Notebooks
---------------------------

By default, each notebook is assigned a single GPU. This is useful for
some uses of notebook (e.g., training a deep learning model) but
unnecessary for other notebook tasks (e.g., analyzing the training
metrics of a previously trained model). To launch a notebook that does
not use any GPUs, set ``resources.slots`` to ``0``:

.. code::

   $ det notebook start --config resources.slots=0

CPU-only notebooks will be scheduled on a randomly chosen agent.
