Jupyter Notebooks
=================

Jupyter notebooks are a convenient way to develop and debug machine
learning models, visualize the behavior of trained models, or even
manage the training lifecycle of a model manually. Determined makes it easy to
launch and manage notebooks. By default, each notebook is assigned a
single GPU. However, this can be modified, see :ref:`cpu-only-notebooks` for
details.

Determined will schedule a Jupyter notebook in a containerized environment on
the cluster and proxy HTTP requests to and from the notebook container
through the Determined master. The lifecycle management of Jupyter notebooks
in Determined is left up to the user---once a Jupyter notebook has been
scheduled onto the cluster, it will remain scheduled indefinitely until
the user explicitly shuts down the notebook. Once a notebook has been
terminated, it is not possible to reactivate it. However, *new*
notebooks can easily be configured to restore the state of a previous
notebook---see :ref:`notebook-state` for more information.
