Hyperparameter Search: Adaptive (Simple)
========================================

The ``adaptive_simple`` search method is a theoretically principled and
empirically state-of-the-art method that adaptively allocates resources
to promising hyperparameter configurations while quickly eliminating
poor ones. There are two interfaces to this search algorithm: the
``adaptive_simple`` method is easier to configure and provides good
defaults for most situations, whereas the :ref:`Adaptive (Advanced)
<adaptive-advanced>` search method allows advanced users to have more
fine-grained control over the behavior of the search.

The ``adaptive_simple`` search method takes two configuration settings:

-  ``max_steps``: The maximum number of steps that any trial that
   survives to the end of the experiment will be trained for (a *step* is a
   `fixed number <batches-per-step>` of batches). This quantity is
   domain-specific and should roughly reflect the number of training steps
   needed for the model to converge on the data set. For users who would like
   to determine this number experimentally, train a model with reasonable
   hyperparameters using the ``single`` search method.
-  ``max_trials``: The maximum number of hyperparameter configurations
   that will be explored. Most of these configurations will *not* be
   trained to convergence; rather, the search method will use
   early-stopping to prune hyperparameter configurations that are not
   performing well.

That is, ``max_steps`` is a property of the model itself (how long the
model must be trained until convergence), whereas ``max_trials``
controls how many resources the user would like the search to consume.
